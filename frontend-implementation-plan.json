Wire digit buttons (0-9) to append to input, operator buttons (+, -, ×, ÷) to store operand and operation, equals button to call backend methods (add, subtract, multiply, divide) via the backend actor, and clear button to reset state. Handle division by zero by checking the backend response and displaying an error message when divide returns an error."
