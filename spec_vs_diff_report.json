  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements reasonably well. REQ-1 backend is fully implemented. REQ-2 UI is implemented with all required buttons and backend integration. REQ-3 visual theme is implemented with dark charcoal colors, accent operators, and centered layout. One minor concern: divide(a, 0) uses Runtime.trap (a Motoko trap/panic) rather than returning an error or null as specified, but the error does propagate to the frontend as a rejected promise, which is then displayed as an error message. The implementation is functionally complete for all ACs.",
